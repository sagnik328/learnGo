1. Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.
2. the basics:
   1. the init stmt: executed before the first iteration.
   2. the condn stmt: evaluated before every iteration 
   3. the post stmt: executed at the end of every iteration 
3. loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evalutes to false.
4. the init and the post statements are optional.
5. If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.
